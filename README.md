# We do a miniscule amount of Warden buffery
This mod buffs the Warden and makes it drop things from randomly selected loot table

## Features
- Buffed Warden and changed its loot 
    - It now has 4000 HP instead of usual 500
    - It now regenerates health on its own with the rate of 1 HP per 10 game tickss (half a second)
    - It is now immune to projectile damage
    - Reduced cooldown of Sonic Boom to 30 ticks instead of 40
    - It will now drop 30000 experience points instead of 5
    - Instead of dropping a single sculk catalyst, it also drops random loot table. It could be from village's chest to end city's chest, giving player more reasons to spawn Warden and get annihilated by it. 
- Modified Attribute Class
    - Max health attribute now caps at 4096
